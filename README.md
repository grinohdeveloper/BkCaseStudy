This project access data source via APIs online and output transactions list and aggregated transaction summary based on location (City). The solution exposes REST - GET protocol which when invoked interacts with two REST APIs (Json and Xml) to formulate the final output. The final output is text/csv and also generates csv files which are saved in a folder. It also interacts with geogle geo-location API to get city name using latitude and longitude values. To access google API a security key is generated in Geo-Location API platform. Since google geo-location API restricts number of request per hour, the program maintains a local copy of city name based on latitude and longitude in a json format. In case the geo-location API is unavailable or doesn't respond with desired results, city name is retrieved from this file. This local copy of cities is preloaded in memory to ensure efficiency is maintained.
